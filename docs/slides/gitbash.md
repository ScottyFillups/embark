# Installing and using Git and Bash

## Nomenclature

Below is a bit of technical nomenclature I'll be using:
* Directory: A folder
* Working directory: The folder you're currently working in

## What is Git?

Git is a __version control system__. What's version control?

Suppose you have to write an essay, and you type up a rough draft and name it `essayrough.docx`:
* You then begin the process of revising your essay, and save your second draft as `essayd2.docx`
* After several revisions, you decide you want to change one of your main points in the essay body
  * You do this, and append `alt` to versions that contain the modified point
  * After spending a lot of time tweaking `essayd5alt.docx`, you decide you prefer your original point
* You then continue to tweak `essayd4.docx` and save it as `essayfinal.docx`

After several hours, your folder looks something like this:

```terminal
  essayrough.docx
  essayd2.docx
  essayd3.docx
  essayd4.docx
  essayd5alt.docx
  essayfinal.docx
```

This is an example of (poor) version control. Keeping track of previous versions is important, in case you want to revert to a previous version.

So, why is this poor version control? It clutters your working directory, and it's unclear what changes were made in between drafts. What's the difference between `essayd2.docx` and `essayd3.docx`? The only way to figure that out is to open each file and compare the contents.

Git is a program that handles version control for you: no need to make funky filenames with version numbers! Cool huh?

## What is Bash?

Bash is an acronym for the __B__ourne __A__gain __Sh__ell, which is a modified version of a shell written by Stephen Bourne.

What's a shell? A shell is a user interface that allows users to interact with the operating system. It could be a GUI, but people usually
