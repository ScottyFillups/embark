# intro-to-windows-webdev

### Live [here](http://scottyfillups.github.io/web-app-tut)

A collection of slideshows teaching a variety of skills which are helpful for web development (currently in the progress of creating them):

* Introduction to Git and Bash
* Beginner JavaScript
* Functional Programming
* HTML/CSS
* Node.js and NPM

These tutorials are primarily targeted toward people who are:
* new to technology and web development
* Windows users (setting up a Mac/Linux environment is trivial)
* practical, and prefer to learn by doing and reverse-engineering examples

If you have difficulty understanding certain slides, or notice any typos, please contact me at [pscott@zeptohost.com](mailto:pscott@zeptohost.com) and I'll revise the slides c:

The slideshows were written in a modified version of markdown, and can be found in `docs/slides`. [remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark) is the tool that was used to transform markdown into slides.
