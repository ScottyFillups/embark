A collection of slideshows teaching a variety of skills which are helpful for web development:

* Introduction to Git and Bash
* Beginner JavaScript
* Functional Programming
* HTML/CSS
* Node.js and NPM
* And more coming soon!


The slideshows were written in a modified version of markdown, and can be found in `docs/slides`. [remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark) is the tool that was used to transform markdown into slides.
